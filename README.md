# Simple-Snake
This project is a simple clone of the game "Snake". It is intended as an exercise in Javascript and basic game programming.

The project follows Coding With Adam's "Coding Snake in JavaScript Complete Tutorial
Every Step explained with HTML5 Canvas" Youtube video at:

Things I did differently from the video to make the game more user friendly:
  - I made the canvas twice as large as the video suggests. This has the effect of    slowing down gameplay, and making the snake more 'snake-like'. It also makes      the snake parts and apples larger and easier to see.
